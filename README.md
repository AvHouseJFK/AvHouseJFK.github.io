# AvHouse JFK

AvHouse JFK is a website about John F Kennedy International Airport (KJFK). It was made for people who are interested in aviation, spotting planes, and keeping up with airport news and events.

## Website

https://avhousejfk.github.io/

## Overview

I built this site myself and keep it updated. It has:

- Active Runways showing which runways are in use  
- AirTracker with live flights and special flights  
- AvNews with news and events at JFK  
- AirGallery with airplane photos  
- Trivia and a leaderboard

The site keeps growing and new features are added over time.

## Behind the Scenes

I do all the coding in HTML and CSS. I also handle the data and updates by hand.  

Work I do includes:  

- Checking and updating runway usage  
- Adding flights to AirTracker  
- Collecting and posting photos  
- Researching JFK facts and history  
- Running trivia and the leaderboard
