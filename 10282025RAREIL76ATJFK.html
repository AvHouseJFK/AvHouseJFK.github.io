          <div class="byline">Published October 28, 2025<br>Edited November 1, 2025</div>

          <h2>Part 1: Arrival - October 28, 2025</h2>
          <p>On October 28, 2025, Silk Way Cargo flight AZQ3004 operated an Ilyushin IL-76TD-90VD, registered as 4K-AZ100, from Bergen, Norway (BGO), to New York JFK. The aircraft touched down at approximately 7:16 AM local time, drawing attention from local spotters such as me. The flight represents the second IL-76 visit to JFK this year, continuing the occasional pattern of special cargo movements from Europe to the United States.</p>

          <h3>Last Minute Runway Change</h3>
          <p>According to live ATC and flight data, the aircraft was initially expected to arrive using the 31 runways. However, due to traffic sequencing and wind updates, JFK controllers issued a last-minute runway change, assigning the 4s instead. The IL-76 landed safely on runway 4R, completing a smooth rollout under clear morning conditions. The rare arrival on the 4s added an unusual visual element for early morning spotters positioned along Rockaway Boulevard and the Bayswater area.</p>

          <h2>Part 2: Departure - October 29, 2025</h2>
          <p>On October 29, 2025, the Silk Way Cargo Ilyushin IL-76TD-90VD departed from KJFK en route to Oslo, Norway. The aircraft departed from JFK at approximately 7:06 PM local time, staying on the ground for over a day (35:50). The flight (AZQ3005) was initially set to take off at 6:00 PM EDT, but was delayed by one hour due to weather, and I couldn’t see it because of the poor conditions.</p>

          <h3>Surprise Takeoff</h3>
          <p>While the IL-76 was on the ground, it wasn’t publicly trackable and only began broadcasting its position and flight data after takeoff. That was a disadvantage for me, since I live near the airport. By the time it appeared on radar, it had already passed overhead.</p>

          <h2>First IL76 arrival at KJFK in 2025</h2>
          

          <h3>ULTRA RARE: Silkway Airlines Ilyushin IL-76TD-90VD [20 YEARS LIVERY] Landing at JFK!</h3>
          <p>On July 25, 2025, I witnessed a truly rare arrival at JFK Airport. A Silk Way Airlines Ilyushin Il-76TD-90VD, equipped with those powerful PS-90A-76 turbofan engines, made a historic landing on Runway 22L. As an aviation enthusiast, this feels like a once-in-a-lifetime catch!</p>
          <p>The jet came all the way from Ankara, Turkey, stopping in Shannon for fuel before touching down in New York. This may be the first time an IL-76TD-90VD from Silk Way Airlines has been publicly filmed landing here. It was amazing to see this massive cargo plane, with its distinctive glass nose and that unforgettable sound from the engines. Definitely a moment I won't forget!</p>
          <p>There are only a handful of these aircraft left flying around the world, and almost none have been spotted in New York. This really is one of the rarest cargo jet sightings in JFK history. I can't help but wonder what it was carrying. Oversized machinery, humanitarian supplies, or maybe something secretive? The mystery adds to the excitement!</p>
          <p><strong>Aircraft:</strong> Ilyushin Il-76TD-90VD<br>
            <strong>Airline:</strong> Silk Way Airlines (AZQ8001)<br>
            <strong>Route:</strong> SNN-JFK<br>
            <strong>Runway:</strong> 22L<br>
            <strong>Filmed from:</strong> Brookville Park - 40.65954157376174, -73.7454327616343</p>

          <h2>Aircraft Background</h2>
          <p>The Ilyushin IL-76TD-90VD is a modernized version of the classic IL-76 cargo aircraft equipped with updated Aviadvigatel PS-90A-76 engines. These engines allow the aircraft to meet modern ICAO noise and emissions standards, enabling operations at major international airports such as JFK that restrict older engine types. Silk Way Airlines, based in Baku, Azerbaijan, operates several of these upgraded freighters on long-range charter and scheduled missions across Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
          <blockquote>Silk Way Cargo are almost always tied to very special cargo missions, so the fact that it came here today is very interesting.</blockquote>

          <h2>Extra Details / Fun Facts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>When the IL76 landed at JFK for the first and second time, it landed on the same runway (22L &amp; 04R).</li>
            <li>This plane was one of the first to land on 04R.</li>
            <li>No delays or runway closures occurred following the arrival. The aircraft taxied safely to its designated parking area.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Operational Notes</h2>
          <p>IL-76 arrivals at JFK are typically related to special logistics or charter operations that cannot be handled by conventional widebody freighters. The aircraft’s rear cargo ramp and heavy-lift capability make it ideal for oversized or urgent loads. Its performance characteristics allow for shorter field operations, giving flexibility to airports with limited slot availability.</p>
          <p>Airport operations confirmed no disruptions occurred to normal traffic. The 4R landing was executed within standard spacing, and the aircraft vacated the runway at high speed, assisted by ground marshals and cargo staff familiar with international charters.</p>

          <h2>Significance of the Arrival</h2>
          <p>This marks the second time in 2025 that an Ilyushin IL-76 has landed at JFK. While rare, such visits demonstrate the increasing global range of specialized cargo carriers. For the aviation community, it is both a technical and visual treat to witness a Soviet-designed freighter in the heart of New York’s busiest international airport.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Silk Way Cargo’s IL-76 arrival at JFK on October 28, 2025, represents a unique and historic moment for JFK. The aircraft’s smooth landing on runway 4R, following a rare last-minute runway change, highlighted the skill of both the flight crew and air traffic controllers. With only two appearances this year, each IL-76 visit remains a highlight for spotters across the region and a reminder of the diverse range of aircraft still serving global logistics today.</p>
