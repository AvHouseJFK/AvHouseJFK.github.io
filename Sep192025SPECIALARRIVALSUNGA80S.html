          <h1>September 19, 2025 — Presidential and Special Arrivals at JFK</h1>
          <p>Today, John F. Kennedy International Airport received a remarkable set of flights. Four of the arrivals carried heads of state or royal leaders. Other movements included a U.S. Air Force support flight, a freighter, and a few rare civilian arrivals. Below are plain English descriptions of each flight: who was on board, what the airplane is, and the flight details.</p>
        </article>

        <!-- USAF C-17 -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>United States Air Force – Boeing C-17A Globemaster III (07-7172) — FAMUS07</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            <div class="pill">Time: 12:17 PM EDT</div>
            <div class="pill">Route: NYG → JFK</div>
            <div class="pill">Runway: 31L</div>
            <div class="pill">Role: Support personnel and equipment</div>
          </div>
          <p>Who was on board: Military support personnel and equipment that help with official visits. This flight did not carry a president, but it supported the large security and logistics needs of the day's events.</p>
          <p>About the plane: The C-17 is a large military transport. It carries heavy and large items like vehicles, secure gear, and group equipment. It is designed to carry many people or heavy cargo for government missions.</p>
          <p>Flight notes: The C-17 moved from a military base to JFK to deliver support for the day's official visitors. It uses military call signs and operates under military rules.</p>

        <!-- Jordan King - long -->
        <section class="card leader">
          <h2>King of Jordan — Gulfstream G650ER (VQ-BNZ) — RJA951</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            <div class="pill">Time: 1:52 PM EDT</div>
            <div class="pill">Route: ADW → JFK</div>
            <div class="pill">Runway: 31L</div>
            <div class="pill">Operator: Government of Jordan</div>
          </div>
          <p>Who was on board: The King of Jordan and his close delegation, including senior advisors and security staff.</p>
          <p>About the plane: The Gulfstream G650ER is a long-range business jet. Even though it looks small compared to big airliners, it is fast and can fly very far without stopping. Governments use G650ERs because they are quick and private. The cabin is set up for meetings, rest, and secure communications.</p>
          <p>What this flight means: The King came to New York for United Nations meetings and private talks. Using a G650ER lets a leader travel with a small team, arrive quickly, and move to official meetings the same day. The plane is set up to keep communications secure and to allow the delegation to work while flying.</p>
          <p>How the flight was run: The plane flew from Joint Base Andrews (a common government airfield) to JFK. This short move brought the King closer to city transport and the United Nations. The aircraft and crew operated under government rules and with close planning for the leader's schedule.</p>
          <p>Extra details: The G650ER is quiet and efficient for its size. It is often used by presidents, prime ministers, and kings for trips where speed, comfort, and privacy matter. The King’s presence on board made this one of the most important flights of the day.</p>

        <!-- Lufthansa A340 -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Lufthansa — Airbus A340-642 (D-AIHW) — DLH400</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            <div class="pill">Time: 1:36 PM EDT</div>
            <div class="pill">Route: FRA → JFK</div>
            <div class="pill">Runway: 31R</div>
            <div class="pill">Role: Regular passenger flight</div>
          </div>
          <p>Who was on board: Airline passengers on a scheduled Frankfurt to New York flight. This plane did not carry a head of state.</p>
          <p>About the plane: The A340-600 is a long, four-engine airliner. It is one of the big, long-range passenger planes that Lufthansa has used for years. This model is becoming less common as airlines move to newer types.</p>
          <p>Flight notes: This was a normal international passenger service. It was noted because the A340-600 is not seen at every airport as often as single-aisle or twin-engine widebodies.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Qatar Emir - long -->
        <section class="card leader">
          <h2>Emir of Qatar — Boeing 777-200LR (A6-MSD) — QAF10</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            <div class="pill">Time: 3:50 PM EDT</div>
            <div class="pill">Route: DIA → JFK</div>
            <div class="pill">Runway: 31R</div>
            <div class="pill">Operator: Qatar Amiri Air Force</div>
          </div>
          <p>Who was on board: The Emir of Qatar and his official delegation, including ministers and security staff.</p>
          <p>About the plane: The 777-200LR is a large long-range airliner often converted for official use by a government. In this role it is fitted with special rooms for meetings, secure communications, and space for many staff members. It is much bigger than private jets so it can carry more people and equipment.</p>
          <p>What this flight means: The Emir's trip was for United Nations meetings and diplomacy. Bringing a large plane like this lets a national leader travel with a full team and with the technical support they need. It also keeps important equipment and staff with the leader for the visit.</p>
          <p>How the flight was run: The plane arrived from the leader’s home region and used a runway that gave good access to secure areas and to transport heading into the city. The aircraft later repositioned to Washington D.C. without the leader on board; that repositioning was to move the aircraft for later missions.</p>
          <p>Extra details: Large government 777s are rare at JFK. Their size and onboard systems make them well suited for long state visits when leaders travel with many people and need secure links to home offices.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Kuwait Amir - long -->
        <section class="card leader">
          <h2>Amir of Kuwait — Airbus A340-541 ACJ (9K-GBB) — KUG002</h2>
          <div class="meta">
            <div class="pill">Time: 4:16 PM EDT</div>
            <div class="pill">Route: KWI → JFK</div>
            <div class="pill">Runway: 31R</div>
            <div class="pill">Operator: State of Kuwait</div>
          </div>
          <p>Who was on board: The Amir of Kuwait and his delegation, including ministers and aides.</p>
          <p>About the plane: The A340-500/541 in ACJ (corporate jet) layout is a long-range widebody aircraft. It has lots of cabin space for meetings, rest, and working. Governments use this kind of plane when they need to bring a larger group and need a comfortable onboard environment for long flights.</p>
          <p>What this flight means: The Amir came for the United Nations and for meetings in New York. The A340 can carry equipment and staff comfortably and is good for long non-stop flights. After its arrival in New York, the plane later moved to a smaller, nearby airport for parking and service without the leader on board.</p>
          <p>Flight notes: The move to a nearby smaller airport later was simply to reposition the aircraft. That repositioning did not carry the Amir; it was an operational move to prepare the plane for its next task.</p>
          <p>Extra details: A four-engine VIP A340 is less common now, so its arrival stood out as a major government transport flight.</p>

          <p>About the plane: Same 777 used earlier that day. Repositioning flights help governments move aircraft to where they are needed next.</p>

          <p>About the plane: The A320LR is a narrow-body jet able to fly longer routes than older narrow-bodies. It is used by some airlines for longer single-aisle flights.</p>

          <p>About the plane: The A330 Prestige is a widebody airplane modified for VIP use. It offers large cabin space, meeting areas, and facilities for long flights. Governments pick this type when they need to bring a full team and want comfortable onboard space for work and rest.</p>
          <p>What this flight means: The President came for UN meetings and other talks in New York. After arrival, the aircraft later flew to a smaller airport without the president on board. That move was for parking or servicing the plane.</p>
          <p>Extra details: The A330 Prestige gives leaders room for meetings during the flight and space for technical equipment and staff. Its appearance at JFK added another full-sized head-of-state aircraft to what was already an unusually busy day.</p>
