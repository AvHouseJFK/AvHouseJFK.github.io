      <p>During UN Week 2025, JFK saw not just one but two United States Air Force C-17A Globemaster III arrivals on consecutive days. This was a slightly uncommon sight for JFK. These massive military transport aircraft typically operate out of strategic bases, such as ADW, but during UN Week, they appear at JFK to support high-level operations.</p>
      
<p>ðºð¸ BANNR90 â Boeing C-17A Globemaster III (00-0175) On September 26, 2025, at 5:03 PM EDT, a Boeing C-17A Globemaster III arrived at JFK under the call sign BANNR90. This was not just any C-17 movement at JFK. It was a Presidential Support mission, directly tied to the logistics surrounding the United Nations General Assembly. Seeing this mission firsthand showed how important JFK became during UN Week, serving as a hub not only for world leaders but also for the aircraft that support them.</p>

<p>ðºð¸ TEDDY45 â Boeing C-17A Globemaster III (07-7171) Just one day earlier, on September 25, 2025, at 5:09 PM EDT, another Boeing C-17A Globemaster III had already made its presence felt. 07-7171, arriving as TEDDY45, touched down at JFK in dramatic fashion. This flight was part of broader United States Air Force strategic lift operations, ensuring equipment and personnel were in place for the UNGA.</p>

<p>My Personal Experience: What made this so unforgettable was not just the rare military movements but actually being there to see them. On the 25th, I almost completely missed the C-17 flyover. The moment I realized it was coming in, I sprinted across the sidewalk and street as fast as I could. Honestly, people around probably thought I was crazy, but I was not going to let such a rare sight pass me by. My heart was pounding just as hard as the engines when I finally caught a view of TEDDY45 landing at JFK, with my ears hearing the extremely loud scream of the engines and my body feeling the ground shake from the power of those MASSIVE Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofan engines.</p>

<p>The very next day, I was ready. After nearly missing out once, I prepared early on the 26th and made sure I was in the perfect position. When BANNR90 thundered in on presidential support duty, it felt like a reward for all the effort. Seeing two C-17s on back-to-back days at JFK during UN Week is something most spotters only dream about, and to capture both was an experience I will never forget.</p>

      <h2>KJFK's Runway operations and information</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h1> Runway Operations</h1>
          <h6> John F. Kennedy International Airport operates with four runways laid out in two crossing pairs: 4L/22R, 4R/22L, 13L/31R, and 13R/31L. The two 13/31 runways are the longer pair, with 13R/31L stretching over 14,500 feet and serving as the primary heavy departure runway, especially for transatlantic and long-haul flights. 13L/31R is slightly shorter and more commonly used for arrivals. The 4/22 pair is generally shorter and used during different wind conditions, with 4R/22L often handling arrivals and 4L/22R handling departures when in use. Runway use is coordinated by the Port Authority and the FAA, balancing efficiency with noise abatement procedures.</h6>

        <h3>Special Approaches</h3>
          <h6>KJFK has a few unique procedures, most notably the Canarsie Approach to Runway 13L and rarely 13R. This visual approach requires aircraft to follow the Canarsie VOR (CRI) and make a late turn over Jamaica Bay, lining up with the runway at low altitude. It is a challenging arrival that requires visual conditions and is famous among aviation enthusiasts. Most other approaches to JFK are ILS-based and straightforward, with precision instrument guidance to all four main runways. Offset approaches may be used occasionally, particularly for Runway 22L, but these are less common compared to the Canarsie arrival.</h6>

        <h3>Joint Runway Usage</h3>
        <h6>Because of the airportâs layout, joint usage of runways is common. For example, during heavy traffic periods, JFK will assign 13R for departures while 13L handles arrivals, maximizing efficiency by using parallel flows. Similarly, during operations on the 22s, 22R may be used for departures while 22L takes most arrivals. Cross-runway operations (such as arrivals on 31L and departures on 4L) can also occur, though they are more complex and often avoided unless winds demand it. The key factor driving runway use is the prevailing wind direction, since JFK operates almost exclusively into the wind.</h6>

        <h3>Wind Direction Considerations</h3>
        <h6>Runway selection at JFK is highly wind-dependent. Winds from the northwest favor the 31s, southerly winds favor the 22s, easterlies put the 4s into play, and westerlies often favor the 31s. Since JFK sits near the Atlantic coast, winds can shift quickly, and ATC frequently reconfigures traffic flows throughout the day. Spotters often track METAR reports or listen to LiveATC to anticipate which runways will be in use.</h6>

    <!-- HISTORY -->
    <section id="history" class="anchor">
      <h2>History of KJFK</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>1939â1948: Planning and Construction of Idlewild</h3> <h6>By the late 1930s, New York City realized that LaGuardia Airport, which had just opened in 1939, was already nearing capacity. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia pushed for a much larger airport that could handle the rapidly growing demand for air travel. In 1942, construction began in southern Queens on land previously occupied by the Idlewild Golf Course. World War II delayed progress, but the project resumed in full force afterward. On July 1, 1948, the new facility officially opened as New York International Airport, commonly referred to as Idlewild. Its design focused on handling international traffic, and it became a symbol of postwar aviation growth.</h6>
        <h3>1950sâ1963: Terminal City and the Jet Age</h3> <h6>During the 1950s and early 1960s, Idlewild underwent massive expansion. Instead of a single central terminal, the airport pioneered the âTerminal Cityâ concept, where individual airlines constructed their own terminals. Pan Am built the futuristic Worldport (Terminal 3) with a flying-saucer roof, while TWA opened the iconic Flight Center (Terminal 5), designed by Eero Saarinen. Other airlines like American and Eastern built their own facilities, creating a unique mix of architecture. The jet age arrived in the late 1950s with the Boeing 707, and Idlewild quickly became Americaâs primary international gateway. In December 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the airport was renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).</h6>
        <h3>1970sâ1980s: Widebody Era and Concorde</h3> <h6>The introduction of widebody aircraft transformed JFK in the 1970s. On January 22, 1970, Pan Am launched the first-ever Boeing 747 passenger flight from JFK, marking the dawn of a new era in long-haul travel. The airport became a hub for jumbo jets, with airlines from around the globe flying 747s, DC-10s, and L-1011s. In 1977, supersonic travel arrived when British Airways and Air France began Concorde service between JFK, London, and Paris, cutting travel time to under 3.5 hours. JFK also became a major cargo hub during this time, with airlines like Flying Tigers and later FedEx establishing operations. By the 1980s, JFK was firmly established as one of the busiest international airports in the world.</h6>
        <h3>1990sâ2000s: Modernization and Security Changes</h3> <h6>By the 1990s, many of JFKâs airline-specific terminals were aging, leading to plans for consolidation and modernization. JetBlue Airways launched in 1999 and soon established its home base at Terminal 6 (later expanded into Terminal 5). The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reshaped aviation worldwide. JFK played a central role during the airspace shutdown, hosting numerous diverted international flights. Tragically, just two months later, American Airlines Flight 587, bound for Santo Domingo, crashed shortly after takeoff, becoming one of the deadliest U.S. aviation accidents. Security tightened significantly, and JFK saw upgrades in screening and passenger facilities. Delta and other carriers began expanding, while older terminals were gradually demolished.</h6>
        <h3>2010s: Redevelopment and New Identity</h3> <h6>Throughout the 2010s, JFK undertook a large-scale redevelopment program. Delta expanded Terminal 4 into a global hub, consolidating its New York operations. JetBlue invested heavily in Terminal 5, and the historic TWA Flight Center was preserved and transformed into the TWA Hotel, opening in 2019 as both a tribute to aviation history and a modern travelerâs landmark. Cargo operations continued to grow, and new airlines like Emirates, Etihad, and Singapore Airlines brought ultra-long-haul services, cementing JFKâs position as a premier international gateway. The introduction of the AirTrain in 2003 also improved access, linking the airport with both the subway and Long Island Rail Road.</h6>
        <h3>2020sâPresent: Transformation into a Mega-Hub</h3> <h6>The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 sharply reduced JFKâs passenger traffic, but by 2023â2025 the airport had rebounded, again serving over 60 million passengers annually. Major redevelopment projects are reshaping the airport for the future: the $9.5 billion New Terminal One will replace the outdated Terminals 1 and 2, while a new Terminal 6 is under construction as JetBlueâs hub, connected to Terminal 5. Delta has consolidated its operations at Terminal 4, and the airport continues to prepare for next-generation aircraft, including A350s, 777Xs, and special diplomatic arrivals. Today, JFK remains the busiest international gateway in the United States and a symbol of New Yorkâs role as a global crossroads.</h6>
